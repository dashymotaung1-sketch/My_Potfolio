    <p>
        I am a dedicated Data Engineer specializing in building robust,
        scalable pipelines using Java and Python,
        with a flair for front-end visualization in JavaScript. I thrive in high-pressure environments,
        turning complex data challenges into streamlined solutions while consistently hitting project milestones."

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a highly motivated developer with a focus on Data Engineering.
        I pride myself on being a dedicated team player who excels under pressure and views deadlines as a personal commitment to quality.

        My technical toolkit includes Java for backend logic, Python for data manipulation and automation, and JavaScript
        for creating interactive web experiences. Currently, I am deepening my expertise in Cloud Infrastructure and Big Data processing,
        aiming to build systems that transform raw data into actionable insights."

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Java Chess Engine</h3>
        <p>
            "Developed a high-performance chess engine from scratch using Java.
            This project involved implementing the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to optimize move searching.
            I focused heavily on memory management and bitboard representation to ensure the engine could evaluate thousands of positions per second.
            It demonstrates my ability to translate complex game theory into efficient, object-oriented code."
        </p>
        <p>
            The Challenge: How do you search through millions
            of possibilities without the computer freezing or running out of memory?</p>
            <p>The Challenge: Ensuring the engine doesn't crash or make an illegal move during these rare moments.</p>

        <p>
            Fix: This is where your dedication and detail-orientation come in. You have to write
            "Unit Tests" for every possible scenario to ensure the engine follows the rules 100% of the time.
            <p>Fix: Implementing Alpha-Beta Pruning. This "prunes" branches of the logic tree that are clearly bad,
            allowing the engine to look deeper into the "good" moves without wasting CPU cycles.</p>

        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>SQL & Databases: You can't do Data Engineering without it (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).</li>
            <li>API Development: Since you know Java and JS, you likely know how to connect systems using REST APIs.</li>
